# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for my macOS development environment, organized in `.config` according to the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html) to keep the home directory clean.

Unlike typical dotfile setups that use symbolic links, this repository mirrors the macOS folders hierarchy, allowing you to directly copy configurations to the appropriate locations.

## Key Tools

- **Shell:** [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- **Editor:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **VCS:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Package Manager:** [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Each configuration is tailored to my workflows but can be easily customized.
