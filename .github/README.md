# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles used to configure and set up the development environment, organised mainly in the `.config` directory according to the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html). This approach helps to keep your home directory clean.

Unlike typical dotfile setups that use symbolic links, this repository mirrors the folder hierarchy of macOS, allowing you to directly copy configurations to the appropriate locations.

## Overview

This repository contains dotfiles for the following applications (but not only):

- **Shell:** [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- **Code Editors:** [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- **VCS Tools:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/)
- **Other Tools:** [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/), [Direnv](https://direnv.net/)

Each configuration is tailored to my workflow but is flexible enough for customization.
